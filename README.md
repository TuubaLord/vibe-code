# PDF Notes App

This simple Flask application lets you store links to PDF articles and leave comments about them.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flask --app app run
   ```

The application uses a local SQLite database (`database.db`) created on first run.
